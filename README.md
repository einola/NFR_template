# LaTeX templates for NFR

This repository contains **_unofficial_** LaTeX templates for Norges Forskningsr√•d (NFR) applications. It consists of three files:

 1. nfr.cls
 2. Template for project description - Researcher project for experienced scientists and early career scientists.tex
 3. README.md (this file)
 4. license.txt (the CC-BY-4.0 license)

The class file (nfr.cls) contains the `nfr` LaTeX class. This is used in the "Template" file, which is a reproduction of the official NFR templates. The "Template" file is a conversion of the official file "Template for project description - Researcher project for experienced scientists and early career scientists.docx", converted to LaTeX by pandoc. I modified the "Template" file to use the nfr document class so that section A of that document is the actual structure, using the \section and \subsection commands, and the other sections are treated as an appendix.

In addition to general formatting, the class file also contains counters and commands for work packages (`\workpackage`) and tasks (`\task`), as well as reference commands (`\wpref` and `\tskref`). There are also counters and environments for objectives (`objective`), hypotheses (`hypothesis`), and research questions (`resq`). The environments have starred (`*`) alternatives which are not numbered. The number prefix can be changed by passing an alternative prefix to the environment.

I have also included four bibliography styles to work with the natbib package. All four aim to reduce the length of the bibliography that's produced. The styles `shortnat` and `veryshortnat` are for author-year references, while `shortnum` and `veryshortnum` are for numbered references. See an example of how to produce Nature-like references in the "Template" file.

This template is based on my ERC LaTeX class, available [here](https://github.com/einola/ERC_template).
